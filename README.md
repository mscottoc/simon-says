# Overview

I made two seperate javascript programs. The first is a game of simon says, where you have to repeat the sequence of colors shown on the screen. The next is a word counter (or cownter if you will) that uses cowsay to show a cow saying how many words are in the text entry.

My goal was to practice CSS and HTML output, array functions, recursion, and using external libraries in the form of a cnd link. I was originaly only planning on making simon says however this did not meet all of my goals, so I added the word cownter to cover the use of libraries and recursion.
